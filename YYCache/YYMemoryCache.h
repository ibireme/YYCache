/**
 YYMemoryCache is a fast in-memory cache that stores key-value pairs.
 In contrast to NSDictionary, keys are retained and not copied.
 The API and performance is similar to `NSCache`, all methods are thread-safe.
 
 YYMemoryCache objects differ from NSCache in a few ways:
 
 * It uses LRU (least-recently-used) to remove objects; NSCache's eviction method
   is non-deterministic.
 * It can be controlled by cost, count and age; NSCache's limits are imprecise.
 * It can be configured to automatically evict objects when receive memory 
   warning or app enter background.
 
 The time of `Access Methods` in YYMemoryCache is typically in constant time (O(1)).
